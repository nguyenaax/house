# Alliance Housing Plot Draft (GitHub Pages)

This repository hosts the "Guild Housing Plot Draft" draft board HTML for the guild raffle.

How to publish:
- Option A (quick):
  1. Put `index.html` at the repository root on the branch you want to serve (e.g., `main`).
  2. On GitHub, go to Settings → Pages and set Source to the branch (root).
  3. Save. Your site will appear at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>`.

- Option B (gh-pages branch):
  1. Create a `gh-pages` branch, put `index.html` at root, push.
  2. In Settings → Pages select `gh-pages` as the source (root).
  3. The site will be available at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>`.

- Option C (GitHub Actions deploy from main):
  - Use `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (provided) to automatically publish on push to `main`.

Notes:
- The page uses Tailwind CDN and Google Fonts. That requires internet access for clients viewing the page.
- The map image is hotlinked from an external host. If that image is not stable, consider storing it in the repo (e.g., `assets/`) and update the `<img src="...">`.
- `.nojekyll` is included so GitHub Pages won't try to process files with underscores.

If you want me to craft a PR or a zip of these files for you to upload, say so and I’ll produce it.
